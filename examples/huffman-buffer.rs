/// Compare two normal styles of implementing tree traversal.
///
/// This uses the static `Constant` style, a dependent version with dynamic
/// buffer sizes might also be possible but requires non-`'static` structs.
///
/// This implements a semi-realistic style for Huffman coding with 8-bit node
/// arity. We have a tree in memory by storing the parent of all nodes and its
/// relative index, which is also its output symbol. A symbol is encoded by
/// following its path to the root and concatenating all bytes on the way. This
/// is done in three styles, each with 1k warm up iterations and then 1M
/// iterations summing their execution time.
///
/// Firstly, using safe Rust code and only the standard library. This does
/// many of the bounds checks at runtime. Judging from the generated
/// assembly, llvm is unable to remember (or check) that indices stored in
/// `parent` are in-bounds of the arrays. Hence when loading them it treats
/// them as an opaque value and does the usual checks against the length.
///
/// The second one uses unsafe Rust code, that one should conventionally
/// avoid to write, asserting to the compiler that we've not stored any
/// invalid parent indices. But this fact is not validated in any way and
/// requires quite a lot of trust in not changing the array sizes. However,
/// it is shown to be fasterâ€”at least on all machines I've tested it on.
///
/// And finally one last style that uses the library. It encodes the allowed
/// range of indices into that special `Idx<_, Tag>` type, and they are
/// checked at construction. But when loading them from the `parent` array
/// we do not need to rely on llvm's ability to see their value range so we
/// have effectively moved the index check of the access to compile time.
/// This retains the performance of the unsafe style with the additional
/// safety against buffer size changes.
///
/// The one thing to look for is the code for `code_of`/`code_of_unchecked`.
/// The arrays parents and bytes are accessed with the `[idx]` operator in
/// the style, with `get_unchecked` in the second and with `get_safe` in the
/// last, otherwise their code is identical.
